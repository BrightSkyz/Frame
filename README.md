# Frame
A simple and easy to use, yet powerful Roblox framework.

## Installation
In the command bar on Roblox studio run the following:

```
local HttpService = game:GetService("HttpService") HttpService.HttpEnabled = true loadstring(HttpService:GetAsync("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrightSkyz/Frame/master/Install.lua", true))
```

For some reason, this doesn't work all the time so if it doesn't work, copy the contents of the Install.lua and paste that into the command bar.
